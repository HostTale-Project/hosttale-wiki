## What is HostTale?

HostTale is an **open-source community initiative** dedicated to making Hytale mod development more accessible and improving the developer experience for everyone. We believe that great games deserve great tools, and that modding should be welcoming to developers of all skill levels.

### Our Mission

We're building a comprehensive ecosystem that empowers developers to create amazing Hytale experiences through:

- **Clear, Actionable Documentation** - Comprehensive guides for Hytale's native modding framework, written by developers for developers.
- **Modern Development Tools** - Community-created project templates and tools like SimpleScripting that complement Hytale's core systems.
- **Language Flexibility** - Documentation for native Java development plus SimpleScripting for those who prefer JavaScript.
- **Knowledge Sharing** - A collaborative space where the community contributes tutorials, best practices, and solutions to common challenges.

Whether you're working with Hytale's native custom UI system, command framework, or Entity Component System (ECS), HostTale provides the documentation and community support you need to succeed.

### Open Source & Community-Driven

Everything we create is open source and built transparently. Found a gap in the docs? Submit a PR. Built something cool? Share it with the community. We grow stronger together.
